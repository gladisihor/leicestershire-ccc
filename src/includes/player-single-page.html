							<p>Leicestershire announced the signing of talented top order batsman Colin Ackermann on an initial two-year contract in October 2016, and the South African extended his stay at the Fischer County Ground an extra two years during the 2018 season.</p>
							<p>Going into the 2019 campaign, Ackermann had an impressive first-class career record with 7,198 runs scored at an average of 41.08 including 17 centuries.</p>
							<p>The batsman had a fine opening two seasons in County Cricket, scoring 618 runs in his debut season, and 876 in his second season in the Specsavers County Championship - including four hundreds across both seasons, as well as an impressive 196* against Middlesex in 2018.</p>
							<p>Another of Ackermann’s standout momenst during his time as a Fox came in the opening NatWest T20 Blast fixture against Lancashire in 2017. With two runs required off the final ball, Ackermann hit a six over cover to get the Foxes campaign off to a flyer. He has since showed a cool head under pressure in a number of fixtures.</p>
							<p>A former South Africa under-19 international, Ackermann had previous experience in the county of Leicestershire after enjoying a successful season for Kibworth in 2012. Ackermann also played a Second XI match for Leicestershire that year, top-scoring with 73 in a low-scoring match against Northants.</p>
							<p>Ackermann's white ball campaign in 2018 was also productive as he boasted an average of 40.85 in the Royal London One-Day Cup with his best score in a match coming in at 71*, as well as an average of 31.18 in the Vitality Blast - his highest score being 74.</p>
							<p>The batsman won the Livingston Cup for batting in the First XI, County Championship Player of the Year and the Roger Goadby Fielding Award for the 2018 season.</p>
