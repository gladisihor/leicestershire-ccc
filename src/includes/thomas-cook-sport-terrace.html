									<h2>Test heading</h2>
									<p><strong>Best seats in the house!</strong></p>
									<p>You can enjoy the best seats in the house by booking yourself into the Thomas Cook Sport Terrace at one of our home Vitality Blast fixtures this summer.</p>
									<p>This unique and informal hospitality area is exclusive to Thomas Cook Sport customers. Situated at mid-wicket on the east side of the ground, the Terrace has a ‘village green’ feel to it and offers a unique vantage point, right on the boundary rope. The Terrace opens 90 minutes before start of play and stays open for approximately 30 minutes after stumps with a cash bar.</p>
									<p><strong>What’s Included?</strong></p>
									<p>As well as access to the Terrace which offers comfortable sofa seating, picnic tables and parasols, you will receive a complimentary welcome drink, a gourmet picnic box, access to an exclusive cash bar and a seat in The Thomas Cook Terrace Grandstand. During the game you are free to come and go from the Terrace as you please.</p>
